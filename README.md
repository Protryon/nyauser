## Purpose

Nyauser is a simplified Sonarr analogue. It specifically aims to fill the gap of anime in Sonarr, as Sonarr is quite bad at managing anime.

## Capabilities

* Scan `nyaa.si` for releases on ongoing anime from a configured set of releaser (see `profiles` in configuration)
* Automatically download those torrents
* Move finished files to a media directory.


## Future Capabilities
* Dynamic series/profile registration via API
* Web dashboard
* Series pack downloading
* Identification and parsing of unknown release groups
* More torrent clients & torrent indexers.
